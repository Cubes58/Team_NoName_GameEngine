# IMPORTANT:
Audio only works in RELEASE mode.

Ali Patel:
With the Audio Manager, it would only work in release mode, rather than debug mode. This was an issue that could not be fixed as I did not understand why it was throwing the error in the first place. The settings matched up with a test project and that worked absolutely fine. So, it was extremely strange that it would only work in release mode. I set it so that the engine/game would only play the sound when in release mode whereas when in debug mode, it wouldnâ€™t play anything. This is to ensure there would be no more errors appearing.
